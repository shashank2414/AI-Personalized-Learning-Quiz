Week 1: Problem Definition and Proposal Preparation

1. Project Title

Personalized Quiz Recommendation System


2. Problem Statement

Traditional e-learning platforms often provide static quiz questions that are the same for all learners, regardless of their learning pace, strengths, or weaknesses. This one-size-fits-all approach leads to inefficient learning, decreased engagement, and poor knowledge retention.

Personalized learning aims to adapt educational content based on individual performance and learning styles, thereby enhancing engagement and outcomes. The specific problem we aim to solve is:

“How can we recommend the most relevant quizzes to each learner based on their past performance and topic proficiency, improving engagement and retention?”


3. Objectives

Analyze learner performance data and identify weak areas.

Build a recommendation system that suggests quizzes tailored to each learner’s needs.

Evaluate the system using accuracy, coverage, and learner improvement metrics.

Deploy a simple interface for interaction and recommendations.


4. Scope

Duration: 4 weeks

Focus on quiz recommendation only, not full course content.

Use a small, simulated dataset of learners, quizzes, and performance scores.

Implement core recommendation logic (Collaborative Filtering or Content-Based).

Create a simple web-based demo or Jupyter notebook showcasing recommendations.


5. Dataset Selection or Creation

Simulated Dataset:

Learner Table: learner_id, name, past performance score per topic

Quiz Table: quiz_id, topic, difficulty level

Performance Table: learner_id, quiz_id, score

We will generate synthetic data (~50 learners, 100 quizzes) for controlled experimentation.


6. Initial Literature Review

"Deep Knowledge Tracing" – Piech et al., 2015: Introduced RNN-based models for predicting student knowledge states.

"A survey of personalized learning approaches" – Explores adaptive learning strategies in e-learning platforms.

Collaborative Filtering in Recommender Systems – Key technique for personalized recommendations.


7. Proposed Solution Approach

Learning Type: Supervised + Collaborative Filtering approach.

Recommendation Strategy:

Start with content-based filtering (recommend quizzes based on topics where user scores low).

Integrate collaborative filtering for similarity-based recommendations.

Tools & Frameworks:

Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn

Surprise library (for collaborative filtering)

Flask or Streamlit for simple UI demo

8. Expected Deliverables by Week 4

Code: Recommendation system implemented in Python.

Dataset: Simulated learner and quiz dataset.

Model: Trained model for generating quiz recommendations.

Documentation: Complete explanation of approach and code usage.

Demo: Simple web-based or notebook-based demo showing personalized recommendations.

Presentation & Video: Short demo video explaining the system.
